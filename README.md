<h1> Hotel Data Analysis </h1>
Here I developed a data analyst project using hotel booking data that I sourced from a database that I created by uploading Excel data sheets. 
The database was connected to Power BI to answer some business questions and have a visual product in the end. 

<br>
<h3> Stakeholder's questions that need to be answered: </h3>
<li> <h5> " Is our hotel revenue growing over the year? "</h5>
We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type. 
<li> <h5> " Should we increase our parking lot size? " </h5> 
We have to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars. 
<li> <h5> " What trends can we see in the data? " </h5>
Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality. 

<br>
<h3> Project Pipeline </h3>
<li> Build a Database: uploading Excel data sheets -(attached to repo)- to Microsoft SQL Server Studio. 
<li> Develop the SQL Query: queries are attached to the repo. 
<li> Connect Power BI to the Database
<li> Visualize
<li> Summarize Findings.
